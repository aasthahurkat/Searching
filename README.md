Problem 1

We need to find out the solution to a 15 puzzle problem with slightly modified rules.
The first case, however works on the typical rules of the game. Out first step was to check whether the puzzle is solvable or not. The function isSolvable() in the program is for the same.
For the second case, we introduced the extra moves which are allowed for the circular moves. If the circular moves are allowed, all the blocks in the puzzle get 4 possible moves - unlike in the original one.
The third case is similar to how a knight moves on a chess board. We defined the moves of the puzzle
